       <h2>Overview</h2>
       <p>The history of ceramics goes way back in time in the seventeen hundreds. Ceramics are made by taking mixtures of clay, earthware elements, powders, and water, which are shaped into forms to create clay pieces. There are many parts that go into creating a clay piece, which start with a slab building. A slab building allows the clay to be formed into a texture that is able to be cut into shapes which then helps to build a piece. This is the first step in creating the piece, such as a sculpture, pots, or plates. The first high fired glaze was produced in China in the seventeen hundreds.  Since China invented high fire glazed ceramics, this gave a new look to the artwork. </p>

<h2><hr>Earthware<hr></h2>



<div class="section">

    <div class="two-col">
    <p>Pit fired earthenware clay goes back to the early 25,000 BC.  Earthenware clay can be glazed or unglazed pottery that is usually fired after the piece is sculpted. The basic earthenware is  usually called terracotta, which absorbs many liquids.  Earthenware clay has a texture that is very smooth and silky feeling. However, the clay can be sanded, which gives it a more gritty texture to the piece.

<h2><hr>Sculptures<hr></h2>





<div class="section">

  <div class="two-col">
  <p>The earliest sculpture made was around 32,000 BC.  The first person who started making sculptures started decorating with clay to create different forms with the clay. This began in Ancient Greece, where artists started creating human bodies. They first made the sculptures out of metal and stone, but then moved to more clay like ingredients. The reason for using this type of material was to make sculptures that were created because of spiritual or religious reasons.   These sculptures were also made with bone, ivory, or stone.

<h2><hr>Slab Building<hr></h2>





<div class="section">

  <div class="two-col">
  <p>The earliest slab building was a pot and is 18,000 years old.  Slab building was mostly used by Mesoamerican Pre-Columbian potters, who designed art by hand to create beautiful pieces. The slab building technique involves rolling out clay to an even thickness, so that the material can be cut into shapes.  Once the material is rolled to its desired thickness, then the folding, bending, and joining together to form a finished art object takes place.
